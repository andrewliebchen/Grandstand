# Visualize your Sprints

[Sprint.ly](http://sprint.ly) is a great tool for Agile development, however it can be difficult to get a good sense of the size of your queue and how stories, tasks, and defects are distributed among your team.

Based on [Scrumly](https://github.com/simpleenergy/Scrumly) with interaction and visualization help from [Isotope](https://github.com/desandro/isotope), your Sprint.ly items are sized by their score, colored by their type, and arranged in a masonry grid.  You can filter your project's items by user, status, type, and score. 

## To do

This method of interacting with a Sprint.ly queue has promise.  Additional features that would make this too more useful: 

* Sort items by number, date added, activity, etc.
* Display item meta information beyond number and title.
* POST operations.
* Build a configuration pane to allow users to input information for their own projects.
* Allow filtering on multiple parameters within the same dimension.
* Figure out how to get around the 100 item API limit.
* Generally push this tool to be a Sprint.ly replacement, rather than just a suplement.
